<dt href="#" id="34"><a href="http://tes5edit.github.io">SSEEdit</a></dt>
<dd>{<a href="https://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:XEdit">STEP</a>}: xEdit is an advanced tool for analyzing and editing Bethesda's game plugins. It works by loading one or multiple plugins (.esp), along with their explicit masters (.esm), and displaying their contents in a specific user interface. It provides a clear layout and useful navigation controls to visualize the data of the loaded plugins, as well as powerful editing functions to clean, edit, or even create new plugins for mods and mod patches.
xEdit was originally developed by ElminsterAU as TES4Edit, for TES: Oblivion. It then was updated to handle Fallout 3 (FO3Edit) and Fallout New Vegas (FNVEdit). Finally, support for Skyrim (TES5Edit), Fallout 4 (FO4Edit), and Skyrim SE (SSEEdit) was added by the authors: Hlp, Sharlikran, and Zilav. These different versions of the tools collectively became known as, "xEdit" within the modding community. Therefore, xEdit is often used to refer to the specific version for whichever game is being discussed.
It is important to note that whichever version has been downloaded, they are all the same executable. It's possible to switch from one version to another by simply renaming the executable to the proper name, or by attaching an argument to the executable, which switches the program for use with a specific game.</dd>

It provides an extremely quick, efficient, and easy-to-use means of extracting Bethesda's archive according to the user need. Moreover, it allow to visualize the content of an archive without having to extract it.
The main "downside" is that the tool is only designed for archive extraction, and won't allow re-packaging of archives. Though originally designed for Fallout 4 archive extraction, and thus available only on the FO4's Nexus section, it supports Skyrim and any other Bethesda games using the .bsa format just as well.</dd>

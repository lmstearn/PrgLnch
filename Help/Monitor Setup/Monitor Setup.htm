<h1>Monitor Setup</h1>
<p>This consists of two forms in sequence relating to the setting up of monitors for first use in PrgLnch.<br>
</p>
<h2>Verify Device Numbers</h2>
<p>This dialog shows up when there exist two or more monitors attached to the desktop. They must be all switched on and connected to the adapter in order to be accessible through Window Settings, the driver settings, and PrgLnch. Click the Monitor buttons so the monitor names match the monitor on which they are shown. If the monitor names are the same, no adjustment is required.</p>
<h2>Missing Stock Resolutions</h2>
<p>These resolutions are detected by WMI for the device, but do not match those in the stock list. They may be available later as custom resolutions set up in the adapter driver user interface.</p>
